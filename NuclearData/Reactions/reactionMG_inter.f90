  !!
  !! Reaction that produces secendary particles in MG
  !!
  !! It is assumed that all outgoing particles are sampled from the same distribution.
  !! They are Independent and Identically Distributed.
  !! Furthermore reactions are assumed to take place in LAB reference frame
  !! In fact Centre-Of-Mass frame has little use for MG reactions as transition
  !! between CoM and LAB frames cannoct be done without intermediate conversion to CE.
  !!
  !! Interface:
  !!   release         -> return number (defReal) of particles producerd on average
  !!   releasePrompt   -> return number (defReal) of particles produced on average without delay
  !!   releaseDelayed  -> return number (defReal) of particles produced on average with delay
  !!   sampleDelayRate -> sample and return delay rate [1/s] assuming exponential distribution
  !!     for the decay.
  !!   sampleOut       -> sample energy and the deflection of outgoing particle
